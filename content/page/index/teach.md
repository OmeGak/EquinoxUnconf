Share an experience of open space with a diverse and interesting group that are cocreating and organising themselves around a shared collection of narratives.

Feel free to interact during sessions and contribute to eachothers journey by sharing stories and ideas together, or simply jump in and organise your own session. We are open to all kinds of contribution. Take a look at the [program](link) to get an idea of who other attendees are and the discussions they are contributing.
