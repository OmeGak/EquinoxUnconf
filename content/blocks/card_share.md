Grab a spade and come community gardening - your help is most welcome!
Volunteering to share your intentions and attention with us in any way is appreciated and we've thought of a variety of ways that people can contribute. For instance we need spacekeepers (linkto) and tech hero's (linkto) but creativity to contribute in any way you like is encouraged and most appreciated.
In that spirit, please drop in to the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/CTPJTNu) if your up for digging a few holes with us - be they self determined or just something thats on a [list](things_to_do)!
