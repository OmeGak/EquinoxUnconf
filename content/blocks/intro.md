title: Equinox Unconference
subtitle: 22nd September 2020

Equinox is a special moment when day and night, sun and moon, shine and shade all fall into balance together across the world as yin meets yang. Paradoxically, in this synchronisation, the transition of solar to lunar energy is at its highest potential and most dynamic capacity - from Autumn Equinox onwards we accelerate towards night.

What better time to gather around the bonfire together and hold an annual self-organising unconference?
