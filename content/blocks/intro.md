title: Equinox Unconference
subtitle: 22nd September 2020
---

We are summoned up on Fall Equinox. We synchronize at this point in time to celebrate our place in life. Amidst the natural forces that move the outer world as much as the inner. Eternally looking for balance, never avoiding paradox. As light casts a shadow, so order breeds chaos. As the sun abandons us, the night pulls us inward. And, once more, the yin meets the yang.

<!-- Equinox is a special moment when day and night, sun and moon, shine and shade all fall into balance together across the world as yin meets yang. Paradoxically, in this synchronisation, the transition of solar to lunar energy is at its highest potential and most dynamic capacity - from Autumn Equinox onwards we accelerate towards night.

What better time to gather around the bonfire together and hold an annual self-organising unconference? -->
