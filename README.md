# Events

There are two ways you can change or add events to the Unconference repo.
First one is by adding makdown (`.md`) files to [Content / Events directory](https://github.com/hack-along/EquinoxUnconf/blob/master/content/events/) or by goint to [Netlify CMS admin pannel](https://vigorous-ritchie-55cc2e.netlify.app/admin).

### Adding Events via Github

To add an event create a .md file in the [content/events directory](https://github.com/hack-along/EquinoxUnconf/blob/master/content/events/).

Use this **front matter** syntax to add any aditonal info before your main content. All of this is optional, but title is strongly recomended. NOTE: this is the human friendly syntax, files generated by NetlifyCMS can be different. If you would like to upload an image, please put it in the uploads/events directory.

### Adding Events via NetlifyCMS

Just go to [Netlify CMS admin pannel](https://vigorous-ritchie-55cc2e.netlify.app/admin) and authorize the github/netlify connection.
From there on you can access the CMS and add or edit your own events. The markdown generated will look slightly different.
